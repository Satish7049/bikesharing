## General Information
- This project aims to predict the daily demand for bike rentals in a shared bike system based on various features such as weather, season, and other conditions.
- **Business Problem**: The project addresses the need to understand and anticipate bike-sharing demand for better resource allocation and operational planning. This is particularly important for BoomBikes, which experienced a dip in revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used is from BoomBikes, which contains daily rental counts along with weather, seasonal, and other factors influencing the demand.

## Conclusions
- **Temperature (temp)**: Warmer temperatures significantly increase bike demand, showing a strong positive correlation with the total rentals.
- **Year (yr)**: The trend indicates growing popularity for bike-sharing services, with higher rentals observed in 2019 compared to 2018.
- **Seasonality**: Summer and fall are peak seasons for bike rentals, while winter shows a decline due to unfavorable weather.
- **Weather Conditions**: Clear weather leads to higher rentals, while adverse conditions like rain and snow reduce demand.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8**
- **Pandas 1.3.3**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy 1.21.2**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib 3.4.3**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn 0.11.2**: For advanced visualization
- **scikit-learn 0.24.2**: For model building and evaluation
- **Statsmodels 0.12.2**: For statistical analysis
